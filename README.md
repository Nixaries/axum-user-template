# axum-user-jwt-template
Basic template for jwt user authenticated axum projects using SQLX with Sqlite.
Currently building with axum 0.7 in mind so the entire axum library is included since this is not a release through cargo yet.
When axum 0.7 is released then this can be moved to being a cargo dependency.
